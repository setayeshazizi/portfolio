Welcome to my personal portfolio website — designed and built with pure HTML and CSS, without any frameworks or media queries. This project is a reflection of my skills, creativity, and attention to design details.

## ⚔️ Challenges I Faced

### 1. Responsive Design Without Media Queries
Creating a responsive layout without media queries was one of the hardest parts.  
To make it work, I:
- Used flexible units like %, vw, fr, auto
- Combined Flexbox and Grid smartly
- Designed sections to naturally adapt to different screen sizes

### 2. Balancing Creativity with Simplicity
I wanted my portfolio to look unique, but not overwhelming.
- I picked a purple & black color theme for elegance
- Used subtle transitions and hover effects
- Paid close attention to spacing, alignment, and font use

### 3. Adding Smooth Animations
To make the site feel dynamic:
- I used @keyframes and transition creatively
- Animated text effects on the homepage (like “ razma portfolio)
- Ensured performance stays smooth even with animations
